    "Security.org reports that an estimated 134 million Americans have been a victim of credit card fraud. Additionally, they estimate that 62 million Americans have experienced it in the past year alone. Unfortunately, this problem is getting increasingly worse. The complexity of the situation and the constant malicious attacks that come with it mean that developing a solution is not only extremely difficult, but also needs to be adaptive to ever changing consumer habits. The goal of this project is to simulate the implementation of a (close-to) production-grade machine learning credit card fraud detection program."
